# SceneBinder Script

## Introduction
This document provides a detailed explanation of the `SceneBinder` script, written in C# for the Unity game engine. The script is designed to bind multiple `PaletteSquare` objects to a single `ColorMixer` object in a Unity scene.

## Overview of the Script
The `SceneBinder` script is attached to a GameObject in the Unity scene. It has a single public variable `mixer` of type `ColorMixer`, which references the color mixer object that the palette squares will be bound to.

### Variables and Properties
The script has one public variable:
* `mixer`: a public `ColorMixer` variable that references the color mixer object (line 5: `public ColorMixer mixer;`).

### Initialization
The `Awake` method is called when the script is initialized (line 8: `void Awake()`). It:
1. Checks if the `mixer` variable is not assigned (line 9: `if (mixer == null)`).
2. If the `mixer` variable is not assigned, logs a warning message (line 10: `Debug.LogWarning("SceneBinder: Mixer not assigned.");`) and returns from the method (line 11: `return;`).
3. If the `mixer` variable is assigned, finds all objects of type `PaletteSquare` in the scene, including inactive ones (line 13: `var squares = FindObjectsOfType<PaletteSquare>(includeInactive: true);`).
4. Iterates through the found `PaletteSquare` objects and assigns the `mixer` variable of each object to the `mixer` variable of the `SceneBinder` script (lines 14-15: `foreach (var sq in squares) { sq.mixer = mixer; }`).

## Purpose of the Script
The `SceneBinder` script serves as a central hub to connect multiple `PaletteSquare` objects to a single `ColorMixer` object. This allows for easy management of the color mixing process and ensures that all palette squares are interacting with the same color mixer.
